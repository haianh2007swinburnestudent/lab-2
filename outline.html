    <h2>Aims</h2>
    <p>
        This project-based unit focuses on developing your skills to build web applications using web technologies. 
        You'll work individually and in teams to tackle real-world web development challenges, building proficiency 
        in selecting and applying suitable tools and techniques. The unit also covers essential aspects of security, 
        ethics, accessibility, and professional communication within web development. Guidance from an academic 
        facilitator will support you in mastering both technical skills and collaborative project management 
        techniques to achieve these objectives.
